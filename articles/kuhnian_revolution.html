          A KUHNIAN REVOLUTION IN EDUCATION
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        In his magnum opus, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Scientific-Revolutions-50th-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B007USH7J2/" target="_blank">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a>”, Thomas Kuhn explained the process of scientific change as the result of various phases of paradigm change.

        Though the world does not change with a change of paradigm, the scientist afterward works in a different world

      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        He described a model of scientific progress in which periods of epistemic cohesion, referred to as “normal science”, were interrupted by the introduction of novel conceptual frameworks, referred to as “revolutionary science.” These interruptions were marked by a re-examination of long-held, obvious-seeming assumptions of the field. The work, pertinent as it is in describing the character of humanity’s greatest achievements, is, in great measure, ignored in studying the nature of technology and its social effects. In this post, I examine how the central tenets of Kuhn’s "Structure" can be applied to interpret how social forces and technology co-construct one another, with an emphasis on the implications of technology for education.

        A framework for understanding technological change
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari-ebook/dp/B00ICN066A/" target="_blank">“Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind”</a>,  Yuval Noah Harari posits that biological forces create constraints on our ability to store, process, and transmit information.  He claims that large-scale cooperation systems, including religions, political structure, trade networks, and legal institutions, were historically conceived to overcome these inherent limitations.

      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        However, he fails to explore how the introduction of technology might nullify the constraints that led to the introduction of a particular social configuration. This insight might be better illustrated through an example that describes how the Ford Model T created Walmart. The absence of affordable automobiles up until the 20th century restricted the distance that a middle-class American could traverse. Customers interested in purchasing consumer goods could only afford to travel to a grocery store within a reasonable distance. Therefore, American towns were littered with general stores that sold a wide variety of goods. However, the invention of the Model T made it affordable to traverse greater distances. That is, the primary constraint that had generated a configuration featuring a store in every town was repealed. One could now create a single retail store that sold goods to multiple towns located within a particular radius. An enterprising retailer named Sam Walton marched on to the scene, establishing his eponymous chain of one-stop-shopping stores in rural America.

        Optimizing the education sector
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        COVID-19 has created one of the most challenging upheavals for educators and students in recent memory. Nonetheless, educators and technology providers have exerted extraordinary efforts to diminish the lingering effects of unfinished learning. Public school districts have partnered with platforms, such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom, to ensure students have access to a virtual learning environment.
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        The education sector could be significantly transformed if one were to acknowledge how pre-COVID restrictions that determined how education is administered no longer apply. That is, the pandemic is a Kuhnian “revolutionary” event that repeals constraints that govern in-person learning, changes the rules of the game, and unlocks previously infeasible possibilities. Therefore, instead of merely replicating how classrooms function, educational technology has an opportunity to enhance student achievement and prepare them for success in a changing economic landscape.
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        Some proposals regarding how student-centric platforms could find the right model of 21st century-education are as follows.
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;margin-left:30px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        1. <span style="font-weight:bold">Individualized instruction: </span> Platforms could perform sentiment analysis on visual content to determine how each student responds to stimuli. While it is rather difficult to assimilate and interpret visual cues in an in-person classroom, technology could be used to assist teachers to determine whether students developed a well-grounded understanding of a particular topic. Additionally, teachers could recognize opportunities for further one-to-one tutoring. An educational phenomenon, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem" target="_blank">Bloom's 2 sigma problem</a>, indicated that the average student tutored one-to-one using techniques performed two standard deviations better than students who learn via conventional instructional methods. Technology could help teachers replicate the phenomenon at scale.

      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;margin-left:30px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        2. <span style="font-weight:bold">Engaging student-to-student interactions: </span> While platforms today facilitate teacher-to-student interactions effectively, they fail to facilitate student-to-student interactions that are an integral part of the education experience. The absence of interactions outside of the lecture exacerbates existing concerns about emotional development. While there is no silver bullet that can reproduce the serendipity of in-person classrooms, technology could remedy the mental health crisis in the following ways.
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;margin-left:60px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        a. Students could be requested to enter information about their passions and hobbies. Matching algorithms could then be applied to group students with overlapping interests. Anecdotal evidence indicates that students are more likely to engage in lectures and interact with peers if they are placed in an environment where they feel comfortable. Data aggregation and clustering could be performed at a scale and a level of granularity not possible without technology.
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;margin-left:60px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        b. Models could be trained to understand the content of what is communicated and crawl the Internet to generate ideas for group activities that are tailored to a particular context. These activities could then be used to facilitate interactions among students.
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;margin-left:60px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        c. Parents could be requested to enter information about where they reside and how inclined they are for their children to interact with their peers in person. Matching algorithms could then be applied to group students that are permitted and willing to meet offline. This might result in a spoke–hub distribution paradigm where students continue to meet peers in person in several mini-classroom biosecure bubbles.

      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;margin-left:30px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        3. <span style="font-weight:bold">Improved pedagogical practices: </span> Platforms could be used to assist educators by immersing them in a continuous feedback loop. Technology could be used to help create better instructors in the following ways.
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;margin-left:60px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        a. A centralized information-exchange platform could be developed to encourage the best-performing school districts to share their learnings. The feed could be used by teachers to ask questions, raise concerns, and stimulate discussions. Furthermore, the platform could also offer course and lecture recommendations for instructors.
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;margin-left:60px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        b.  Platforms could help instructors conduct more effective lectures. They could evaluate pace, pitch, diction, and tone to generate a report including statistics and suggestions for improvements.
