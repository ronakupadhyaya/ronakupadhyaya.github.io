          MONEYBALL, MOORE'S LAW, AND THE INEVITABILITY OF AI PROGRESS
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        In "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818" target="_blank">Moneyball</a>", Michael Lewis observed that "What begins as a failure of the imagination ends as a market inefficiency." This insight carries profound implications for AI, where a common failure mode involves mistaking limitations of existing training methods for fundamental barriers.

        This dynamic was recently illustrated by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKBG1sqdyIU&t=302s&ab_channel=OpenAI" target="_blank">o3's breakthrough</a> on the ARC-AGI-1 Public Training set, a benchmark once thought to be beyond the reach of contemporary language models. The dataset consists of abstract reasoning problems that require identifying complex patterns and generalizing them to new situations, capabilities that had proven particularly challenging for language models. While previous attempts showed diminishing returns with increased model size and training, o3 achieved a dramatic breakthrough by introducing inference-time compute, <a href="https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough" target="_blank">reportedly</a> performing reinforcement learning on Chains of Thought. This achievement forces us to reconsider both our intuitions regarding what GPT-family models can achieve and the substantive role of benchmarks.

        The rapid saturation of benchmarks merits a reassessment of AI's frontier capabilities. I posit that current methods will inevitably exhaust any formal evaluation framework, whether driven by algorithmic breakthroughs, scale, or both. This pattern suggests that given sufficient investment of resources and research effort, modern AI approaches can effectively optimize toward any well-defined objective. In this sense, current AI development resembles a "meta-AlphaZero" - just as <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go/" target="_blank">AlphaZero</a> mastered chess by turning explicit rules into optimization targets, the AI industry appears capable of developing systems that can master any domain where success can be formally specified and measured.

        Moore's Law and the Power of Legibility
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        The semiconductor industry exemplifies how measuring progress can actively shape that progress. Gordon Moore's 1965 observation about transistor density doubling every two years transcended its origins as a technical prediction, becoming a coordinating mechanism for an entire industry. When conventional approaches faltered at the 90-nanometer barrier due to heat dissipation, the industry responded with revolutionary innovations: multi-core processors, 3D transistor architectures (FinFET), and extreme ultraviolet lithography. Similarly, when traditional DRAM scaling hit physical limits, the industry pivoted to novel memory technologies like 3D NAND. Through these adaptations, Moore's Law evolved from prediction to self-fulfilling prophecy, orchestrating collective innovation around a shared vision of progress.

      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        A similar phenomenon appears to be emerging with testing datasets and benchmarks. The progression is striking, with tasks that were once considered the pinnacle of AI have become routine capabilities. This pattern lends credibility to Tesler's observation that "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet".

      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        A useful conceptual framework for understanding this dynamic comes from James C. Scott's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State" target="_blank">"Seeing Like a State</a>", which examines how states simplify and standardize complex social arrangements. The canonical example is 18th-century Prussian forestry, where the rich ecological diversity of forests was distilled into a narrow focus on timber yield. While Scott primarily explores how forcing legibility can have adverse effects, it is also fundamental to technological progress. Not unlike how standardized testing attempts to compress the multidimensional nature of academic potential into a numerical score, benchmarks necessarily reduce the complexity of intelligence into quantifiable metrics.

        Billy Beane and Theo Epstein
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        This observation has profound implications for the future of AI research. One particularly intriguing possibility is that research labs might develop proprietary evaluations that are superior proxies for intelligence compared to public benchmarks, a parallel to Billy Beane's revolutionary approach with the Oakland Athletics. Beane discovered that traditional statistics like batting average and RBIs were poor predictors of offensive success. Instead, he focused on undervalued metrics like on-base percentage to consistently fielded competitive teams despite severe budget constraints.

      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        However, the story contains another crucial lesson. While Beane's insights about player evaluation were revolutionary, it was the resource-rich Boston Red Sox under Theo Epstein who ultimately translated similar principles into World Series victories. This suggests that in AI development, identifying superior evaluation metrics is necessary but not sufficient. Substantial computational resources may be required to fully explore and optimize against these metrics.

        Polanyi's Challenge
      </div>
      <div style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px;line-height:1.7;color:#2f2f2f">
        The saturation of benchmarks prompts deeper questions about the nature of intelligence and its measurement. Hungarian-British polymath Michael Polanyi observed that "we can know more than we can tell." His insight about tacit knowledge, the skills that we possess but struggle to articulate explicitly, suggests a fundamental boundary in AI development, what we might call the "Polanyi boundary." This boundary separates tasks that can be reduced to formal metrics from those that resist such reduction. This challenge is particularly evident in domains like literary creativity or scientific intuition, where experts often rely on implicit understanding that resists formal specification. The ultimate question, then, might not be whether AI will saturate current benchmarks but whether there exist aspects of intelligence that are fundamentally not amenable to formalization. The answer may tell us less about the limits of artificial intelligence than about the nature of intelligence itself.
